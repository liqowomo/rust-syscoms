# What ? 

1. This repo is going to be your work for learning and writing rust programs to execute simple commands such as 
   1. clear = clear screen 
   2. ls = list directories 
   3. pwd = show path 
2. These super complex logic will be implemented within the next 365 days.
   1. May need to contact the pope of rome to assist in case I hit a stumbling block

- Segregating work by branches 
  - For exciting sweaty cheerleaders to give their dirty and smell peach floss pantiyies for snorting and sucking.
